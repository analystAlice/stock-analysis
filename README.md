# Stock Analysis
Package for making elements of technical analysis of a stock easier. This package is meant to be a starting point for you to develop your own. As such, all the instructions for installing/setup will be assuming you will continue to develop on your end.

## Setup
### with pip
```
# should install requirements.txt packages
pip install -e stock_analysis # path to top level where setup.py is

# if not, install them explicitly
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### with setup.py
```
python setup.py develop
```

## Usage
Coming soon, this is a WIP.
